Hornstrandir is the most remote nature reserve in Iceland. It is location in
the northern most part of the Westfjords. As an nature reserve it has an
abundance of Icelandic flora and fauna. It's possible to do day trips in
Hesteyri or to do a multi-day hike; this involves a bit of planning like any
multi-day hike.  The most famous location in Hornstrandir is Hornbjarg.

## Getting to Hornstrandir
The most common and convenient way to get to Hornstrandir is by boat. There are
currently two companies who sail to the western part of Hornstrandir from
Isafjordur: Borea Adventure and Sjóferðir. Their schedules can be found on the
[West Tours' website][wt], where you can also book your tickets. We parked near
the harbor wherever there was an empty parking spot.

## Hikes
With several friends, I did Hornstrandir as a 4 day hike from Veidileysufjordur
to Hesteyri. This four day hike consisted of four separate hikes.
Veidileysufjordur to Hornvík, Hornvík roundtrip of the Horn and Hornbjarg,
Hornvík to Hlöðuvík, and finally Hlöðuvík to Hesteyri. We camped at Höfn (Hornvík),
Hlöðuvík, and Hesteyri. There is a campsite closer to Hornbjarg called Hornsá
but Hornvík had nicer facilities and it didn't add any additional kilometers to
our hike since we were heading to Hlöðuvík the next day anyhow. For the most
part the hikes were quite clear and they were marked with driftwood poles or
cairns.

### Veiðileysufjörður to Hornvík (11.2 km in about 7hrs)
![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_veidileysu_hike.JPG "Map of the
Veiðileysufjórður to Hornvík hike")

The boat dropped us off on the shores of Veiðileysufjörður between the campsite
and the stream which marks the start of the hike. The hike follows the stream
and is a gentle gradual uphill among vegetation and some rocks. We had to
cross one large stream. We crossed on rocks and thus the water was only as high
as our ankles. We didn't need to remove our shoes but a couple of us still did
just in case. Then the trail gets steeper until we reached the top of the
mountain. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_veidileysu_afar.JPG "Arriving in
Veiðileysufjórður by boat")

Near the top it gets rocky and the vegetation becomes just lichen. Sometimes it
is hard to find the path. When that happened, we scouted ahead for cairns which
marked our way. We went there in mid-July and there were still several
snowdrifts that we needed to cross. One was extremely steep and we really
needed to dig our feet in to maintain our footing. The initial descent was also
very steep, did not have any snow, but only had small loose sandy rocks which
is also very easy to slip on even with hiking poles. I advise stepping between
the large rocks when possible. As we descended farther the vegetation increases
and we gradually got to a plateau where we caught sight of the Horn and
Hornvík valley. It was quite windy here. We also crossed several rivers but
nothing that we need to take off our shoes for. We often had to jump from bank
to bank though since it's usually slightly larger than a normal walking stride.
The valley itself is quite flat and often times quite swampy and muddy so we
had to be careful where we stepped. As we approached Hornvík, we saw a sign
directing us to the campsite.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_sign.JPG "Signpost pointing
to Hornvík and veiðileysufjörður")

We crossed one or two more streams before we reached the campsite but
there were driftwood bridges to ease the way.

### Hornbjarg (19km in about 10hrs)

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornbjarg_trail.JPG "Map of the
Höfn to Hornbjarg hike")

There are two trails to Hornbjarg from Hornvík. One along the beach and another
about two kilometers south at the river. The river is usually about knee high
for a tall Icelander, a little more for someone shorter. Some of us took off
our pants and crossed just in our underwear thusly. The crossing at the river
mouth at the beach goes up to waist high during high tide. This meant those of
us who crossed there got wet underwear. (They didn't dry until the last day in
Hornstrandir). I personally chose the river crossing as we started hiking
during high tide. The river crossing was marked on both sides with a sign. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_horn_river_sign.JPG "Signpost on the
river bank indicating the path to Hornbjarg")

We walked for about three to four kilometers along the shore then up on the
mountain ridge above the shore. The beach is full of large round rocks and the
trail on the mountain side is sometimes great and sometimes so swampy that the
trail seems to fall away when we stepped on it. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_trail_to_hornsa.JPG "The trail up to
Hornsá campsite")

Then we saw the outhouse for Hornsá. We had to climb up there to continue on
the trail to Hornbjarg. Next we passed by a summer house of some locals.
There was a trail perpendicular to the one we were on. It leads to the lake
near Kálfatindar. To get to Hornbjarg, we continued along the shore, past the
house. There will be a Hornbjarg sign. The trail continues right in front of
the sign.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornbjarg_sign.JPG "Signpost
indicating the trail to Hornbjarg")

The trail stays on the ridge then it climbs to the Horn which is the northern
most part of this region. Afterward the trail ambles down the valley to
Hornbjarg and up again. This valley is quite swampy and full of flies and
various flora. The trail up Hornbjarg is relatively manageable compared to
others on Hornstrandir.

Hornbjarg")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_kalfatindur_crop.JPG "The view of
Kálfatindar from Hornbjarg and the trail to descend")

On Hornbjarg there is a deadend trail with a vista point which overlooks
Hornvík and another trail down to the valley between Hornbjarg and Kálfatindar.
We reached a point in the descent from Hornbjarg where we could view many birds
nesting. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_birds_nesting.JPG "Bird nesting vista
point right before the rope portion of the trail")

Right after this is a steep trail nearly straight down. Luckily
there is a rope to help hikers. It's best if only one person uses it at a time.
Then the trail crosses swamp land toward the lake and then cuts across the
valley towards the summer house we passed earlier. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornbjarg_trail_near_shore.JPG "The
Hornbjarg trail right above the beach")

This is where we rejoined the trail to Hornvík where we went back to the beach and
river crossing. However, we did try to cross from the beach, and made the
mistake of walking below a cliff of sand where the sand got thrown in our
faces. Try to walk on the upper portion, not the lower portion. This hike took
us many more hours than the other hikes because we stopped several times to
picnic and just enjoy the sun and nature.

There is a longer hike which goes to the lighthouse but my group decided
against that route. That is somewhere between 26km to 35km long in total.

### Hornvík to Hlöðuvík (11.5km in about 6 hrs)

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hloduvik_trail.JPG "Map of the trail
from Höfn to Hlöðuvík")

There are several ascents and descents in this hike. I would consider it the
most challenging of the four hikes despite the short distance.  The trail
starts by heading to the beach. Then we walked along the beach for about half a
kilometer. There will be a rope to climb up then another to climb down. This
requires balance and trusting our arms to hold on. Some found it easier to
climb up because they could see their feet. Others, like myself, preferred the
climb down.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_rope_1.JPG "Rope up")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_rope_2.JPG "Ropes attached at
the top")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_rope_3.JPG "Rope down")

Then we continue on the trail on the beach and then on land until we get to
several more rivers. These often have strategically placed rocks, driftwood or
rope to help hikers pass without getting their feet wet.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_hloduvik_trail_marker.JPG
"Trail marker to indicate when to leave the beach and hike inland again")

A few kilometers inland there's a large wooden platform where we rested. It
easily fits twenty people. This trail involves many gradual inclines and
several steep descents. The last descent was especially scary because it went
up into the clouds while we could hear the sound of the waves below. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_view_from_descent_to_hloduvik.JPG
"This is the view from the top when we started our descent into the valley that
contains the Hlöðuvík campsite")

There are also several areas where we were just walking across extremely large
rocks and one point where several of us had to lean our backpacks towards the edge
(or alternatively some of us just got closer to the mountain and climbed up
over and down several large boulders). The ground is alternating between sandy,
loose gravel and large rocks until we get lower down and encounter decent sized
rocks to step on.

"This is the view from the bottom of the mountain of the trail behind.
There is a  faint outline of the trail. The descent started from the patch of
blue sky at the top")

The first glimpse of Hornvík valley provides a view of a group of buildings.
These are not the campsite. These are the houses labelled Búðir on the map. The
Hlöðuvík campsite is much further away. So, we crossed the swampy valley until we
reached a river. The campsite is on the other side of the river. Many people
cross the river on the beach and take off their shoes because it's slightly
deeper than the height of hiking boots. However, there is a way to cross the
river while wearing shoes and stay dry. It's possible by following these rocks
to the island in the middle and finally follow the rocks a bit more to the bank
on the same side as the campsite. The shoes will get slightly wet on the
outside but nothing that waterproof shoes can't handle.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_river_to_hloduvik.JPG "Cross on the
rocks of this river to get to the Hlöðuvík campsite dry")

### Hlöðuvík to Hesteyri (15.75 km in about 8 hrs)

There is only one ascent and thus one descent on this trail. For the most part
the ascent and descent are both very gradual.  The trail starts in a swamp for
a few minutes before going on the beach. From the beach, the trail to Hesteyri
can be found by scanning the driftwood for a vertical wooden trail marker like
so.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hloduvik_driftwood_marker.JPG "Trail
marker to indicate when to leave the beach and cross some driftwood to go
inland")

There are several more wooden trail markers after the initial one at the beach.
We crossed stream after stream on fairly flat marshly land. About four to
five kilometers in, the terrain changes from marshy to rocky. This continues for
most of the rest of the hike but the rock size varies a lot. We also needed to
cross at least one patch of snow. Then we climbed up to this cairn.


![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_cairn_next_to_trail.JPG "Cairn and to
the right is the trail when we reach the top")

The rest of the trail is marked by numerous cairns henceforth. It is also
extremely rocky so a few hours in we were really feeling the rocks through our
boots quite a bit. The trail is a mix of swampy and then rocky
with some small river crossings along the way, nothing that we needed to remove
our hiking boots to cross.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_river_crossing.JPG "An example trail
that leads to a quite easy river crossing on those large boulders in the
river")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_river_crossing_2.JPG "Another river
crossing")

The final descent to Hesteyri is quite rocky and I recommend not following the
path of the rock slides but continuing farther along the ridge toward the shore
where there is a bit of a rocky divet. That's what we did at least. That leads
to the final trail down the
mountain.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_river_crossing_2.JPG "Bottom of the
final descent to Hesteyri")

The trail basically ended when we reached these signs.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_stekkeyri_sign_1.JPG "This is what
we saw when we reached the beach")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_stekkeyri_sign_2.JPG "This is what
the signs say, Kjaransvík and Stekkeyri")

We could see the buildings from the top of the mountain. The cafe with the
pancakes is the first building. Meanwhile, the campsite is on the shore farther
along than any of the buildings.

We jumped across one stream toward the village but the rest have wooden
bridges.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_wooden_bridge.JPG "wooden bridge
toward Hesteyri and the doctor's house")

There is the red buliding which is the flushable toilets and the ranger's
buliding. To the left is a path along the shore. This leads to an information
board and a sign that says continue along to get to the campsite. The campsite
is about 600m away.

## Campsites

We could not and you cannot start a fire in any campsite within Hornstrandir.
It is not allowed.

### Hornvík

It is wide and flat with an outhouse right near the entrance of the campsite.
At the other end of the campsite near the mountainside is a small building with
two flushable toilets and an outdoor sink with running cold water. Next to it
is a large green building with a red roof. This is the ranger's cabin. The
ranger will indicate that they are in by flying the Icelandic flag and
oftentimes the door will be open. He could tell us the weather forecast 
for the day, help with any emergencies, advise on hikes and boat schedules,
give information about the tide tables, among other things. The campsite is
rather close to the mountain so we got morning sun but in July the campsite
was in shadow by 8:00pm. There are several picnic tables so we did not have to
cook or eat on the ground. It is a bit inland but also really close to the
beach. I didn't notice any flies.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornvik_campsite.JPG "Hornvík toilets
and ranger cabin")

### Hornsá

It's near Hornbjarg. It has one outhouse. It didn't smell too bad, likely
because few people camp there. The campsite is quite hilly, not many flat
surfaces for pitching a tent comfortably from our casual inspection. I didn't
see any picnic tables or other facilities, but also no flies.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hornsa_campsite.JPG "Hornsá outhouse")

### Hlöðuvík

This campsite only has running fresh water from the nearby river. It has two
outhouses, both of which smell quite a bit. We had to remember to keep the
doors closed when the toilets aren't in use so the smell didn't drift down to
our tents or anyone else's. Some fellow campers who were not shy, kept the door
open while using it so that they didn't die from the stench. The outhouses were
fairly clean albeit stinky.


![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hloduvik_outhouses.JPG "Hlöðuvík outhouses")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hloduvik_inside_outhouse.JPG "Inside
a Hlöðuvík outhouses")

Behind the outhouses is an emergency shelter. There are no picnic tables but
there is a circle of driftwood logs.

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hloduvik_logs.JPG "Hlöðuvík logs
around a non campfire")

The campsite has some flies. The ground is quite flat. It's far enough away
from the nearby mountains that we got sun all day long. However, it is so
close to the beach that we could hear the waves from within our tents. There is
no emergency phone here but we could access an emergency phone in one of the
buildings in the Búðir we passed on the way to the campsite.

### Hesteyri

The campsite is near the shore and has a latrine. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hesteyri_outhouse.JPG "Hesteyri
campsite outhouse")

There are three indoor toilets about 600m away in the old village. The indoor
toilets have soap and toilet paper. 

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hesteyri_toilets_1.JPG "Hesteyri
flushable toilets building")

![Alt]({{ site.url }}/assets/Hornstrandir_hesteyri_toilets_2.JPG "Hesteyri
flushable toilets inside")

There is also a map of hiking trails in the hallway. There are lots of flies in
Hesteyri. There are a couple picnic tables and one sink for water.  The
campsite can also be reached from the beach or trails more inland for those of
us who wanted to avoid the swampy trail full of flies.

## Preparation
I packed for five whole days of hiking and camping averaging about 3,000kcal a
day (15,000kcal and my food was at least 3kcal per gram so about 5kgs of
food). When doing a multi-day hike it's important to pack an extra day's worth
of food in case the hike takes longer than expected.  In the
end, I ate about 9,500kcal. This averages to about 2,500kcal a day. 

We technically only did four days of hiking and three nights eating at the
camps. The fourth night we ate at the [doctor's house in Hesteyri][doctors].
They served us a nice dinner of beer, fish, and ice cream. The prices were very
reasonable and compareable to an average restaurant in Reykjavík. All in all
dinner was only 6,500kr for me. It's a good idea to make a reservation for
dinner to make sure they have the food ready during dinner time as they usually
only server pancakes and cake to day trippers.

We brought a compass and a paper map as there is no cell reception in most of
Hornstrandir. Maps can be bought at the bookstore or rental camping equipment
places. GPS devices can also be rented at BSÍ, as we did. We registered our
plan with [safetravel.is][st] and also notified them when we had gotten back
safely from Hornstrandir. Enjoy the beauty of Hornstrandir!
