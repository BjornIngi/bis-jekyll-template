        <p>The Úlfarsfell, "Úlfar's Mountain", hike is in Mosfellsbær and Reykjavík. It is within the capital's metropolitan area. Regarding the name, no one knows why Úlfarsfell has the name that it does. </p>
        <p>The highest point is 296 meters (971 ft) high at Stórhnukur, but people often only hike up to Hákinn which is 280 m (918 ft) high. The hike is about 5 km (3 miles) long round-trip if you want to do the full hike. It can be shorter if you prefer to take some closer paths back. It is a pretty popular hike with locals both as a weekend hike and as part of their daily exercise routine.</p> 
        <h2>Getting to Úlfarsfell</h2>
        <p>
If you go by car, I recommend that you park at the Hamrahlíð parking lot, which is the first exit at a roundabout if you're driving from Reykjavík to Mosfellsbær. There are two other parking lots, one exclusively for 4x4 SUVs. The 4x4 SUV route also has a Stræto bus stop nearby if you want to bus to Úlfarsfell. Bus #15 stops there. The stop is called Vesturlandsvegur/Úlfarsá. Úlfarsá means Úlfar's river.</p> 
        <h2>Hike details</h2>
        <p>The hike is quite rocky, with lots of loose sharp rocks. That's why I recommend only hiking in some sturdy hiking shoes. When it has recently rained or the spring melts are underway, some of the lower paths become very muddy so bring waterproof hiking shoes during that time. The hike is often windy so always bring at least a windbreaker. Depending on the weather, you might also need to bring clothing which protects your extremities (e.g. nose, neck, and ears) from the cold wind. If you're not an experienced hiker, you'll definitely get thirsty on this hike so make sure to bring some water.</p>
        <p>There are multiple possible paths to take, with varying degrees of difficulty. The difficulty mostly has to do with how fast and steep you're willing to hike to get to the peak. Families often come here with their kids. There are orange poles to mark the hiking paths. Sometimes it feels like there isn't another one but if you walk for just a few minutes another pole comes into view.</p>
        <p>The hike provides a beautiful view of the nearby city and towns, as well as a glimpse of Snæfellsjökull, the "Snæfells penninsula glacier" on a good day. The hike generally doesn't take more than couple hours round trip.</p>
